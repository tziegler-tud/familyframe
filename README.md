# FamilyFrame

## Everyday is special (unless you work in IT). Share it with your family!

The goal of this project is to ~solve Regular Path queries~ create a software infrastructure to enable live-sharing of memorable moments with your friends and family, with the intent of displaying these pictures on a digital photo frame setup in your friends/parents/grandparents living room.

### design goals:
#### Accessible: 
Uploading and displaying pictures should be quick, easy and accessible in order to motivate users to actively contribute to the picture gallery.

#### Secure: 
Family pictures are very personal and to be shared with a selected group of people. We will make sure these data is safe.

#### Extendible: 
We start with a simple web application for uploading pictures and managing channels, as well as a viewer software for SbO-powered display stands. Lets see where we are going from there.
